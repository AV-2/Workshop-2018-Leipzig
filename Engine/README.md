# Engine

This is the collaboration area for the engine project at the 2018 Macaulay2
workshop in Leipzig.

## Team members

 * Dylan Peifer (djp282@cornell.edu)

## Potential projects

 1. Producing a set of documentation and examples for writing code in the
    engine and linking with a package. The goal is to make it possible for
    package authors to read about how and why (or why not) to move parts of
    their package into the engine.

 2. Writing functions to perform polynomial long division, minimalization, and
    interreduction. These functions should be heavily tested and benchmarked.
    The goal is to give top-level users more fine-grained control over the
    steps in producing a Groebner basis, and provide building blocks for a
    Groebner walk algorithm in the engine.

 3. Writing an M2 kernel for Jupyter. Clark Spessard (not attending the
    workshop) has a [working version][1] that we could modify or improve. The
    goal is to distribute a working kernel for Jupyter with a standard
    Macaulay2 install.

Feel free to comment or suggest further projects!
